# Webpack

webpack is a <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> static module bundler </Color> for modern JavaScript applications.

When webpack processes your application, it internally <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> builds a dependency graph </Color> from one or more <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> entry points </Color>
and then <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> combines every module your project needs </Color> <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> into </Color> one or more <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> bundles </Color>,
which are <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> static assets </Color> to serve your content from.

<Admonition type="info" title="info">

Since version 4.0.0, webpack does not require a configuration file to bundle your project.

</Admonition>

## Entry

An entry point indicates which module webpack should use to <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> begin building </Color> out its internal dependency graph.

Webpack will figure out which other modules and libraries that entry point depends on (directly and indirectly).

&#8203;<Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> By default </Color> its value is `./src/index.js`,
but you can specify a different (or multiple) entry points by setting an entry property in the webpack configuration.

For example:

```javascript title=webpack.config.js showLineNumbers
module.exports = {
  entry: "./path/to/my/entry/file.js",
};
```

## Output

The output property <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> tells webpack where to emit the bundles it creates </Color> and how to name these files.

It defaults to `./dist/main.js` for the main output file and to the `./dist` folder for any other generated file.

You can configure this part of the process by specifying an output field in your configuration:

```javascript title=webpack.config.js showLineNumbers
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./path/to/my/entry/file.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "my-first-webpack.bundle.js",
  },
};
```

In the example above, we use the `output.filename` and the `output.path` properties to tell webpack <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> the name </Color>
of our bundle and <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> where we want it to be emitted </Color> to.

## Loaders

Out of the box, webpack <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> only understands </Color> JavaScript and JSON files.

Loaders allow webpack to <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> process </Color> <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> other types of files </Color> and <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> convert </Color>them into valid modules that can be consumed by your application and added to the dependency graph.

At a high level, loaders have two properties in your webpack configuration:

- `test` property identifies <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> which file(s) should be transformed </Color>.
- `use` property indicates <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> which loader(s) should be used </Color> to do the transforming.

```javascript title=webpack.config.js showLineNumbers
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  output: {
    filename: "my-first-webpack.bundle.js",
  },
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.txt$/, use: "raw-loader" }],
  },
};
```

<Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)">

The configuration above has defined a `rules` property for a single module with two required properties: `test` and `use`.

</Color>

This tells webpack's compiler the following:

> Hey webpack compiler, when you come across a <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> path that resolves </Color> to a `.txt` file **<Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> inside of </Color>** a `require()` / `import` statement,
> use the `raw-loader` to transform it before you add it to the bundle.

<Admonition type="caution" title="caution">

Keep in mind that when using regex to match files, you <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> may not quote it </Color>.

i.e `/\.txt$/` is not the same as `'/\.txt$/'` or `"/\.txt$/"`.

The former instructs webpack to match any file that ends with `.txt` and the latter instructs webpack to match a single file with an absolute path `.txt`.

</Admonition>

## Plugins

While loaders are used to transform certain types of modules,

plugins can be leveraged to perform a wider range of tasks like

- bundle optimization
- asset management
- injection of environment variables

In order to use a plugin, you need to `require()` it and add it to the plugins array.

Since you can use a plugin multiple times in a configuration for different purposes, you need to create an instance of it by calling it with the new operator.

```javascript title=webpack.config.js showLineNumbers
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const webpack = require("webpack"); //to access built-in plugins

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.txt$/, use: "raw-loader" }],
  },
  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: "./src/index.html" })],
};
```

In the example above, the `html-webpack-plugin` generates an HTML file for your application and automatically injects all your generated bundles into this file.

<Admonition type="tip" title="later">

There are many plugins that webpack provides out of the box! Check out the [list of plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins).

## Mode

By setting the `mode` parameter to either `development`, `production` or `none`,

you can enable webpack's built-in <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> optimizations </Color> that correspond to each environment.

The default value is `production`.

```javascript title=webpack.config.js showLineNumbers
module.exports = {
  mode: "production",
};
```

## Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).

<Admonition type="tip" title="later">

Webpack needs Promise for [`import()` and `require.ensure()`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports). If you want to support older browsers, you will need to load a polyfill before using these expressions.
