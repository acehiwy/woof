# Installation

## Prerequisite

Webpack 5 runs on Node.js version 10.13.0+.

## Local Installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash title=
npm install --save-dev webpack
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash title=
yarn add --dev webpack
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

If you're using webpack version > 4 and want to call webpack from the command line, you'll also need to install the CLI.

```bash title=
npm install --save-dev webpack-cli
```

</Admonition>

## Global Installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash title=
npm install --global webpack
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash title=
yarn global webpack
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="caution" title="caution">

Note that this is not a recommended practice.

Installing globally locks you down to a specific version of webpack and could fail in projects that use a different version.
