# Output

The output property <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> tells webpack where to emit the bundles it creates </Color> and how to name these files.

It defaults to `./dist/main.js` for the main output file and to the `./dist` folder for any other generated file.

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

Note that, while there can be multiple entry points, <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> only one </Color> output configuration is specified.

</Admonition>

## Usage

The minimum requirement for the output property in your webpack configuration is to set its value to an object and provide an `output.filename` to use for the output file(s):

```javascript title=webpack.config.js showLineNumbers
module.exports = {
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
  },
};
```

This configuration would output a single `bundle.js` file into the `dist` directory.

## Multiple Entry Points

If your configuration creates more than a single "chunk", you should use substitutions to ensure that each file has a unique name.

```javascript title=webpack.config.js showLineNumbers
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    app: "./src/app.js",
    search: "./src/search.js",
  },
  output: {
    filename: "[name].js",
    path: __dirname + "/dist",
  },
};
```

This will output `./dist/app.js` and `./dist/search.js` files.
