# Markdown links

There are two ways of adding a link to another page through

- URL path
- file path.

```markdown title= showLineNumbers
- [URL path to another document](./installation)
- [file path to another document](./installation.md)
```

## URL path

URL paths are <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> unprocessed </Color> by Docusaurus, and you can see them as directly
rendering to `<a href="./installation">`,

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

URL paths will be resolved according to the page's URL location, rather than its file-system location.

</Admonition>

## File path

If you want to reference another Markdown file <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> included by </Color> <Color color="var(--primary-font-color)"> the same plugin </Color>,
you could use the <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> relative path </Color> of the document you want to link to.

Docusaurus' Markdown loader will <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> convert </Color> the <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> file path </Color>
to the target <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> file's URL path </Color> (and hence remove the .md extension).

For example, if you are in `docs/folder/doc1.md` and you want to reference

- `docs/folder/doc2.md`
- `docs/folder/subfolder/doc3.md`
- `docs/otherFolder/doc4.md`:

```markdown title=docs/floder/doc1.md showLineNumbers
I am referencing a [document](doc2.md).

Reference to another [document in a subfolder](subfolder/doc3.md).

[Relative document](../otherFolder/doc4.md) referencing works as well.
```

Relative file paths are resolved against the current file's directory.

Absolute file paths, on the other hand, are resolved <Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> relative to the content root </Color>,
usually `docs/`, `blog/`, or localized ones like `i18n/zh-Hans/plugin-content-docs/current`.

<Admonition type="note" title="note">

Absolute file paths can also be relative to the site directory.

However, beware that links that begin with `/docs/` or `/blog/` are not portable as you would need to manually update them if you create new doc versions or localize them.

</Admonition>

```markdown title= showLineNumbers
You can write [links](/otherFolder/doc4.md) relative to the content root (`/docs/`).

You can also write [links](/docs/otherFolder/doc4.md) relative to the site directory, but it's not recommended.
```

<Admonition type="danger" title="danger">

Markdown file references only work when the source and target files are processed by the same plugin instance.(eg. docs plugin , blogs plugin)

This is a technical limitation of our Markdown processing architecture and will be fixed in the future.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="danger" title="danger">

If you are linking files between plugins (e.g. linking to a doc page from a blog post), you have to use URL links.

### <Color color="var(--not-require-but-good-to-know-font-color)"> Benefits of using file path </Color>

Using relative file paths (with `.md` extensions) instead of relative URL links provides the following benefits:

- Links will keep working on the GitHub interface and many Markdown editors
- You can customize the files' slugs without having to update all the links
  - **<Color color="var(--secondary-font-color)"> //\\\\ </Color>** update markdown url without change its references in other files
- Moving files around the folders can be tracked by your editor, and some editors may automatically update file links
- A versioned doc will link to another doc of the exact same version
- Relative URL links are very likely to break if you update the [trailingSlash config](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/docusaurus-config#trailingSlash)
